## 🚀 Quick Integration

### Step 1: Add the Widget Script
Add this **single line** to your website, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script 
  src="https://mouna-ai-chatbot-production.up.railway.app/widget-fixed.js" 
  data-api-key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">
</script>
```

### Step 2: Replace Your API Key
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Mouna API key.

### Step 3: That's It! 
The widget will automatically appear as a floating chat button in the bottom-right corner of your website.
