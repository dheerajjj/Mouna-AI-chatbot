# Email Setup Instructions for OTP

## Overview
Your app now has a complete OTP-based signup and login flow with real email sending capabilities. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Titan SMTP Setup (Recommended for support@mouna-ai.com)

If your mailbox is hosted on Titan (e.g., support@mouna-ai.com), configure SMTP with these environment variables in Railway:

```bash
# Required
EMAIL_PROVIDER=titan
EMAIL_USER=support@mouna-ai.com
EMAIL_PASS={{TITAN_APP_PASSWORD}}

# Optional overrides (defaults shown)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.titan.email
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
EMAIL_FROM=support@mouna-ai.com
```

Notes:
- Generate an app password in your Titan control panel, then set it as EMAIL_PASS.
- Keep EMAIL_PASS secret in Railway Variables. Do not commit it.
- The app automatically falls back to console logging if credentials are missing.

async function testEmail() {
    try {
        await EmailService.sendSignupOTPEmail('test@example.com', '123456');

    }
}

testEmail();
```

### Test OTP Flow

4. Verify the OTP works
5. Complete account creation

## 7. Current Status

Without email credentials, the system will:

- ‚úÖ Store them in the database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Log emails to console instead of sending them

With email credentials, the system will:
- ‚úÖ Send real emails to users
- ‚úÖ Complete the full signup flow
- ‚úÖ Provide professional user experience

## 8. Monitoring & Debugging

### Server Logs
Watch for these log messages:
- `üîê OTP generated and sent for pre-registration verification`
- `‚úÖ Signup OTP email sent to:`
- `‚ùå Failed to send signup OTP email:`

### Email Service Status
The EmailService automatically falls back to console logging if credentials are missing. Check server startup logs for:
- `‚úÖ Email transporter configured successfully`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Email credentials not found. Email notifications will be logged to console.`

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Set up email credentials** (critical for production)
2. **Test the complete flow** with real emails
3. **Monitor email deliverability** and reputation
4. **Consider upgrading to SendGrid** for production scale
5. **Set up email analytics** to track open rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Gmail Authentication Error**: Make sure 2FA is enabled and you're using an app password
2. **Emails in Spam**: Configure SPF, DKIM records for your domain
3. **Rate Limiting**: Gmail has sending limits - consider SendGrid for high volume
4. **Firewall Issues**: Ensure port 587/465 is open for SMTP

### Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a simple email first
4. Consider using a dedicated email service for production
